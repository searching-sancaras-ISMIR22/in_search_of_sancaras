### 1. Results Explorer
You can explore all results presented in the paper, and more, using the Google Colab notebook  [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/115wznvNTr0cdaKN3EBWuCJMz3n-A7P-J?usp=sharing). This includes pitch plots and audio corresponding to the pattern groups returned for a selection of Carnatic performances in the [Saraga Dataset](https://mtg.github.io/saraga/).

The pitch plots corresponding to the paper results are also available in `ouput/for_paper/pitch_plots/`.

### 2. Data
All datasets and models presented in the paper are made available...

### 3. Overview of Process

Include diagram here

### 4. Code Usage

#### 4.1 Install
Requires Python 3.8, to install requirements...

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### 4.2 Relevant dependencies
The pipeline requires a model trained using the Complex Autoencoder architecture [[github]](https://github.com/SonyCSLParis/cae-invar) and pitch annotations of the predominant melodic line extracted using FTA-NET trained on the SCMS dataset [[github]](https://github.com/TISMIR22-Carnatic/carnatic-pitch-patterns)  (see **Table 1** in **2. Data** for data and models)

#### 4.3 Configure

To configure the pipeline update the configuration file at `conf/conf.yaml`, in that folder you will find a README detailing each parameters function.

#### 4.4 Run
To extract the silence/stability mask for a pitch track, `<folder>/<pitch_track>.csv`using the parameters specified in `conf/mask.yaml`:

```
python src mask --config conf/mask.yaml
```

To extract the self similarity matrix for a pitch track, `<folder>/<pitch_track>.csv` masked with `<folder>/<mask>.csv` using the parameters specified in `conf/selfsim.yaml`:

```
python src selfsim --config conf/selfsim.yaml
```

To run the melodic pattern extraction pipeline using the parameters specified in `conf/pattern.yaml`:

```
python src pattern --config conf/pattern.yaml
```

There are more detailed explanations of each parameter in the `conf/` directory.
